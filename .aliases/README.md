Adding this folder to the `Path` Environment Variable allows to easily run the scripts from the command line.

Basically put all the alias/shortcuts in this folder and add the folder to the `Path` Environment Variable.

Then just run the scripts from the command line.

eg: `art` instead of `php artisan`, because of the `art.bat` file in this folder.
